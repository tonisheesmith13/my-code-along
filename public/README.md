## 02.3 Code Along (Components, JSX, and Props Review)

Let's use React to create an online menu for the Code Nation Creamery!

1. Right now we have the `App` component, but we need one to hold the menu options. Let's create a new functional component called `IceCrea` that returns a div tag. Can someone take me through the steps?

2. Inside the div tag, someone tell me how I'd create a list tag that displays a flavor using propName your prop 'flavor'?

3. Finally, in App, let's add three IceCream components that receive your flavor props strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. Can someone take me through the steps for this?
